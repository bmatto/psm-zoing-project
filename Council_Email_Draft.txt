Subject: Data-Driven Analysis of Portsmouth's Residential Zoning and Housing Capacity

Dear Mayor McEachern, Assistant Mayor Trace, and Members of the City Council,

I hope this message finds you well. As a member of the School Board and having served on the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee for Affordable Housing, I'm writing to share an analysis that I believe warrants serious consideration as we continue addressing Portsmouth's housing challenges.

THE CURRENT APPROACH

The recommendations from the Affordable Housing Committee have primarily focused on two strategies:
1. Developer incentives – leveraging our existing zoning constraints and offering to soften those constraints in exchange for affordable units or in-lieu payments
2. City-owned property partnerships – working with the Portsmouth Housing Authority and organizations like POAH to develop municipally-owned land

While these are valuable and important pieces of our overall housing strategy, they fundamentally ignore what the data shows is the elephant in the room: the 2,276 acres of residential land zoned exclusively for single-family homes.

THE DATA

Using property data pulled directly from the New Hampshire State GIS database, I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of Portsmouth's zoning landscape. The findings are striking:

LAND ALLOCATION DISPARITY
• Single-family ONLY zones (R, SRA, SRB): 2,276 acres (85.8% of residential land)
• Multi-family ALLOWED zones (GRA, GRB, GRC): 375 acres (14.2% of residential land)

We have dedicated six times more residential land to single-family-only development than to zones that permit the housing types most residents can actually afford.

FISCAL IMPACT
The revenue density comparison is stark:
• Single-family only zones: $1,033,384/acre
• Multi-family allowed zones: $5,904,630/acre

Multi-family zones generate 5.71 times more tax revenue per acre while accommodating 4.37 times more housing units per acre. From a pure fiscal sustainability standpoint, our current zoning is actively working against the city's financial health.

INFRASTRUCTURE BURDEN
The analysis reveals that single-family zones require:
• 1.15x MORE linear infrastructure per parcel (roads, utilities, etc.)
• Estimated infrastructure cost: $51,721 per parcel vs. $44,976 for multi-family
• Fiscal sustainability ratio: 15.9 for single-family vs. 23.9 for multi-family

In practical terms, our lower-density zones are more expensive to serve per household while generating less tax revenue. Multi-family zones effectively subsidize the infrastructure costs for sprawling single-family neighborhoods.

THE COMPLIANCE CRISIS
Perhaps most concerning: 69.9% of parcels in single-family zones are OUT OF COMPLIANCE with current zoning requirements:
• 1,783 parcels have lots smaller than the minimum size requirements
• 435 parcels have incompatible land uses
• R zone: 85.4% violation rate
• SRA zone: 50.5% violation rate
• SRB zone: 71.8% violation rate

We are sitting on thousands of legal non-conforming properties that cannot be reasonably rebuilt, expanded, or modified without seeking variances. This creates a de facto freeze on housing evolution in the majority of our residential neighborhoods.

PROPOSED PATH FORWARD

Rather than continuing to focus exclusively on developer incentives and city-owned parcels, I propose we consider zoning reforms for our three largest residential zones:

1. RESIDENTIAL (R) ZONE - 498 acres
   Current: 217,800 sf minimum (5 acres), single-family only
   Proposal: Reduce to 1-acre minimums, allow two-family homes by right
   Expected impact: Increase from 41 parcels to potential 250+ housing units

2. SINGLE RESIDENCE A (SRA) - 589 acres
   Current: 43,560 sf minimum (1 acre), single-family only
   Proposal: Reduce to 15,000 sf minimums, allow two-family and small multi-family
   Expected impact: Increase density 3x while maintaining neighborhood character

3. SINGLE RESIDENCE B (SRB) - 1,189 acres
   Current: 15,000 sf minimum, single-family only
   Proposal: Reduce to 7,500 sf minimums, allow two-family by right, multi-family by special exception
   Expected impact: Bring 1,672 undersized parcels into compliance, double housing capacity

These changes would:
• Bring thousands of non-conforming parcels into compliance
• Increase tax revenue density across our largest residential zones
• Reduce per-household infrastructure costs
• Create hundreds of new housing opportunities without requiring city investment
• Improve fiscal sustainability for essential city services

THE OPPORTUNITY COST

Every year we maintain zoning that dedicates 85.8% of residential land to single-family-only development is a year we:
• Force housing demand into the 14.2% of land that allows multi-family
• Increase pressure on our already tight housing market
• Make our city less accessible to teachers, municipal workers, young families, and service workers
• Reduce our ability to fund schools, infrastructure, and city services

MOVING FORWARD

I would welcome the opportunity to present this analysis to the full Council and Planning Board. The data is comprehensive, drawn directly from state sources, and paints a clear picture: our largest opportunity for addressing housing capacity and fiscal sustainability lies in reforming the zones we've largely avoided discussing.

Developer incentives and city partnerships are valuable tools, but they're treating symptoms while ignoring the underlying cause. We have 2,276 acres of residential land that is fundamentally mis-zoned for the city Portsmouth has become and the future we're trying to build.

I'm happy to share the complete analysis, methodology, and supporting data files at your convenience.

Respectfully,
